# Grid Puzzle Game
A randomly generated grid puzzle game that is inspired by some of my favorite Nonogram and Picross puzzle games. 
The player can click on the squares in the grid to change their color (one click for pink, two for gray).
The goal is to color the correct squares following the clues printed on the left side and top of the grid that correspond to the number of colored squares in sequence in each row/column.
